When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository allows you to collaborate with others and serves as an
offsite backup.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are working on a new feature, you probably want the base you are building
upon to remain static until you have the feature working. Only then would you
pull the latest changes to see how they affect your feature.
