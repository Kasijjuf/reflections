When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository allows you to collaborate with others and serves as an
offsite backup.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are working on a new feature, you probably want the base you are building
upon to remain static until you have the feature working. Only then would you
pull the latest changes to see how they affect your feature.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

A fork is a repository on GitHub that is a clone of another repository on
GitHub. A clone is a duplicate of another repository, regardless of where the
original is located. A branch is a name assigned to a commit and all of its
parents. A fork is useful when you want to have your own version of someone
else's project to make changes to. Cloning allows you to make changes to a
project from a computer other than the one on which the project is stored.
Branches allow you to develop different features and versions of a project
seperately and merge them at will with ease.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

If you are going to be offline for an extended period of time, it can be
beneficial to see what others have been working on so you can merge in their
changes and continue working instead of having to wait until you are online.



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and
what would be harder?

Now that I'm familiar with Git and GitHub, I don't even want to think about
collaborating on a software project without them. Emailing files back and forth.
Saving multiple copies of files locally. Shudders.
